# Data donation app for NIH submission. 
Base code was forked from https://github.com/d3i-infra/data-donation-task 

Modifications were made to make the app compatible with TikTok data donations and to extract user communication profiles from their donation. Currently, the app only supports TikTok.

A consent page will be added to the landing page after consulting with our IRB and Prof. Wisniewski.

To run the application, follow the instructions on the source repository: https://github.com/d3i-infra/data-donation-task
